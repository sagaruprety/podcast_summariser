# podcast_summariser

This is a side project built as part of the Uplimit (https://uplimit.com/) free course - Building AI Products with OpenAI, which was offered between 14th and 21st August 2023. The idea was to build an app which summarises and extracts relevant information from any given podcast link. OpenAI's large language model was utilised for the summarisation and information extraction part. Their whisper model was used to transcribe podcast episodes.

Modal (https://modal.com/) was used to deploy the backend of the app to the cloud. This repo contains files for a Streamlit frontend app.
